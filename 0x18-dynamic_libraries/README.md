Go to your root
Clone the required repository
cd into the cloned repository
get current error message ### ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9
get the function calls used to develop the program about to tampered with. ### ltrace ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9
Having seen it, we use printf to inject our new command(feel free to pick any function call of choice)
To see how printf prototypes works - ### man 3 printf
NB: how to know what correct message to print ü§î ### string gm | less
The above displays the messages required
Man 2 write(using this we learn how to use write and what libraries to call)
Okay üôÇ
Now create a C file and call printf (check the image below for clarity)
Using the correct prototypes for printf and write...
Now write the required code. üêã
Now to inject the printf function to alter the result of the program
gcc -fPIC -c file.c
gcc -shared -o file.so file.o
LD_PRELOAD=/"where-gm-islocated"/file.so ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 - 9
NB under normal circumstances the required output should print.
9 8 10 24 75 - 9 Congratulations, you win the Jackpot!

If not then an error message would occur like 'cannot be preload' or 'cannot open object file'
Don't worry.

Not go back to the 0x018-dynamic_libraries

Create a C file and repeat number 10 an image will be sent below

Now make that file a dynamic Library

Now create the required .sh file for the last advanced task you can Google about how to write the shell script to link to your GitHub and access the dynamic Library. an image will be sent below too to see what you're expected to do. üëçüèΩüéä
